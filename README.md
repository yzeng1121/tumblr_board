## Notes

I had a lot of challenges while attempting to build the requirements of this project. For one, it was difficult to learn 
how to utilize and manipulate a table view in both code and the actual storyboard. Ultimately, I didn't complete all of
the requirements on time, but it was still fun to debug and learn more about the different Swift components. I hope to
revisit this project in the future to fix and improve the UI.
